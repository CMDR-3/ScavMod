# ScavMod

ScavMod is a modloader designed for [Scavenger SV-4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/779590/Scavenger_SV4/) or (potentially, untested) any other games made in Ogre 1.8.</br>
The way it works is by targeting the core Ogre 1.8 framework which is very documented, instead of the game executable itself. This prevents needless hours reversing the game, at the cost of writing out a large majority of the Ogre API.</br></br>
You can check out the [wiki](https://github.com/CMDR-3/ScavMod/wiki) for more information.

### ScavMod is NOT finished!!!</br>
It is quite an ambitious project, and may not be finished for a while!! I'll accept your help if you're knowledgable about this, though :)
